                I am ready for the road less traveled. Already{" "}
                <a href="#">brushing off the dust</a>. Yeah, you're lucky if
                you're on her plane. I used to bite my tongue and hold my
                breath. Uh, She’s a beast. I call her Karma (come back). Black
                ray-bans, you know she's with the band. I can't sleep let's run
                away and don't ever look back, don't ever look back.

                I'm intrigued, for a peek, heard it's fascinating. Oh oh! Wanna
                be a victim ready for abduction. She's got that international
                smile, oh yeah, she's got that one international smile. Do you
                ever feel, feel so paper thin. I’m gon’ put her in a coma.

                From Tokyo to Mexico, to Rio. Yeah, you take me to utopia. I'm
                walking on air. We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead. I
                mean the ones, I mean like she's the one. Sun-kissed skin so hot
                we'll melt your popsicle. Slow cooking pancakes for my boy,
                still up, still fresh as a Daisy.

                Don't need apologies. Boy, you're an alien your touch so
                foreign, it's <em>supernatural</em>, extraterrestrial. Talk
                about our future like we had a clue. I can feel a phoenix inside
                of me.
